Recently, digitalization of documents has become an important part of information systems and related workflows. By digitalization, documents from governmental, administrative, educational and publishing workflows are being processed to a more accessible, searchable and manageable form.

To convert the printed text documents back into digital text form, digitalization tools employ \emph{optical character recognition} (OCR). OCR engines are used to recognize individual text elements of a scanned document and output them in a more suitable format, e.g.~as rich text or a searchable PDF file.

Specialized OCR algorithms exist to handle various specific input document layouts where general OCR would produce sub-optimal or unusuable results; e.g. for tickets, passports, car plates or postal envelopes. Tabular documents form a wide, useful category of structured input --- table recognition algorithms must be able to process various features found in the tables, including inconsistent border formatting, different alignment, spanning cells, or misaligned columns and rows. Currently, the available table-recognition software is, in most cases derived, from text-oriented OCR algorithms and recognizes only limited amount of all possible table features.

The main goal of this thesis is to explore the existing OCR techniques and software, and create a new table-recognition OCR software that can provide better results than the currently available tools. The resulting software uses an external OCR engine and image-processing libraries to preprocess the input images and extract simple text elements, which are then heuristically combined into words, lines, table columns and whole tables. Finally, it produces an easily readable JSON-formatted output that describes the layouts of tabular and textual elements in the processed document. The generalized JSON output may eventually converted to other, more specific formats.

There exist a lot of other OCR engines which provide similar features as Tesseract. Under existing open-source OCR software are, for example, CuneiForm, GOCR, Ocrad or OCRopus. They all support basic character recognition, with slight differences in the number of recognized languages, types of symbols, provided features, accuracy of results and in the general focus of the recognition (e.g. scanned documents, barcode detection). Although they all produce satisfactory results, none of them provides the user with table recognition.

Table recognition is a problem addressed by algorithms presented by~\citet{tableDetHeterogeneous}, \citet{TRecs}, \citet{MediumTable}, \citet{pdf2table} and many more. However, most of the available implementations are outdated, closed-source, or do not provide results of satisfactory quality.

\paragraph{Layout of this thesis} This thesis is structured as follows: In Chapter 1, we review the obstacles that complicate character recognition and show existing solutions for some of them; after that we describe several techniques and heuristics for text recognition. In Chapter 2, we describe implementation of existing table recognition algorithms. Chapter 3 details the implementation of our software, including the heuristic used for table detection and recognition. Performance measurements, results and summary of the improvements are presented in Chapter 4. After the last chapter, we conclude with a brief overview of possible future work.
